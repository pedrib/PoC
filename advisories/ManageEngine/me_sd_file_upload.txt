>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload and directory traversal (authenticated)
CVE-2014-5301
Constraints: user login needed, but exploitable with the default low privilege guest account (u:guest/p:guest)
Affected versions (inclusive): ServiceDesk Plus / Plus MSP v5 to v9.0 v9030; AssetExplorer v4 to v6.1; SupportCenter v5 to v7.9; IT360 v8 to v10.4

POST /common/FileAttachment.jsp
POST /workorder/Attachment.jsp (older versions < v7 build 7016; AssetExplorer v4; all SupportCenter versions)

It is possible to abuse a directory traversal vulnerability when uploading attachments. A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.
Post data has to be formatted as a multi-part request with an embedded ear file. Below is the form data for the newer versions:

#2
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload (unauthenticated)
CVE-2014-5302
Constraints: no authentication or any other information needed except for IT360 (guest account needed); code execution is only possible by replacing one of the <install_dir>bin/ scripts and waiting for them to be executed or for a periodic task to run. This is because only text files can be uploaded as binary files are mangled; and there no JSP compiler in the $PATH.
Affected versions: ServiceDesk Plus / Plus MSP v7.6 to v9.0 build 9026; AssetExplorer v? to v6.1 build 6106; IT360 v? to v10.4

>> Fix:
#1 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9031. It is UNFIXED on all other products. Disclosure to ManageEngine was done on 04/08/2014, so over 150 days have elapsed. The last communication I received from them was that "Once we released this fix in ServiceDesk plus, we eventually take this in other products like AssetExplorer and SupportCenter."

#2 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9027 and on AssetExplorer 6.1 build 6107. It is UNFIXED for IT360.
